"# Capybara-Website" 

This website marks my first ever completed web designing project. This project was done over the course of the Fall 2022 semester in and outside of "SE 186x" class. I focused mainly on the HTML and CSS portions, while Max Strater handled most of the JS portions. The two of us plan to continue developing this website to make functions more user-friendly and also improve the overall quality of the project.

Every new Software Engineer had to start somewhere, and this is that place for me.

I hope I can look back on this in a few years and be proud of how far I have come.

Happy coding,
Alex Moeller
